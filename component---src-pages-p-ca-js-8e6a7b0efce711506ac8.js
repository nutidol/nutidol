It is common to see human staff deliver room services when the customers request any orders such as food and hotel amenities to hotel guests. However, this creates the following problem: Request being centralized at the reception, Efficiency, and Human resource allocation. When customers would like to order the extra items from their room, they have to call the front reception and wait for the staff to carry the items to their room. Many people feel uncomfortable because they are guilty and shame to interrupt the staff. Therefore, the customers may give up the order and the hotel might lose the benefits from losing the order. Avocabot would help to deliver any items to the customers whatever and whenever they want without interrupting the front reception."),r.createElement("p",null,"Sometimes the overload problem occurs at the reception. When many customers want to order the food and amenities at the same time. The orders are loaded at the front, the receptor might miss some orders which might cause consequences. With Avocabot, the orders will be recorded in the system. The efficiency of the system will be enhanced to a higher standard. Human resources are the key part of the success of the business. Hotels can totally reallocate human resources, and allocate them to be used more efficiently. When wasting human staff to only do the labour work, some abilities might be wasted even though the hotel can manage to gain more benefits from the missing capabilities."),r.createElement("blockquote",null,r.createElement("p",null,"Avocabot aims to solve these problems by automating in-door logistics and providing a user interface that the fingertip can resolve for any customer.

To make one order, the customer makes a request to the hotel reception, in the simplest way, through a phone call. At this process, they need to wait for the reception to take the call which could take a long time due to centralization of work at the reception and the reception might miss the order as mentioned in 1. When the recipient accepts the call, the customers make a request for services such as ordering the food or asking for toiletries. The reception will take the order and send it to the department that is responsible for it, either through a phone call or hotel systems. After the specific departments have prepared for the service needed, the department either deliver the order themselves or call the reception to send the people to make a delivery.

className=\"text-center text-secondary\">\n        What should we do if we’re getting bored during the lockdown due to the\n        spread of COVID-19?\n      </p>\n      <h3 className=\"pb-2\">Overview</h3>\n      <p>\n        The project is created with the aim of designing based on usability\n        heuristic to confirm that the application will follow the usability\n        requirements, for instance, it should have memorability such as easy to\n        use or make the user become familiar with; it should have learnability\n        as the application was designed for anyone to use, and it should deliver\n        satisfaction as users achieve the goal of using the application such as\n        spending their free time to do some beneficial activities. Before\n        designing, we need to define the problem by exploring it then create the\n        empathy map to understand the user’s perspective. Another important step\n        is that we need to create some personas to actually create the story or\n        the user journey map.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"px-5\">\n        <Carousel prevLabel nextLabel interval=\"2000\">\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img className=\"d-block w-100 \" src={bu1} alt=\"First slide\" fluid />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={bu2}\n              alt=\"Second slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img className=\"d-block w-100 \" src={bu3} alt=\"Third slide\" fluid />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img className=\"d-block w-100 \" src={bu4} alt=\"Third slide\" fluid />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img className=\"d-block w-100 \" src={bu5} alt=\"Forth slide\" fluid />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img className=\"d-block w-100 \" src={bu6} alt=\"Fifth slide\" fluid />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n        </Carousel>\n      </div>\n      <h3 className=\"pb-2\">Personas</h3>\n      <p>\n        Let’s say Som Ying is a woman at age 21 who lives with her family. She’s\n        get bored from cooking the same menu and ran out of ideas about making a\n        dish. She also wants to use up her ingredients as much as she can. And\n        her overall goal is to find recipes to cook for herself as well as for\n        her siblings. So, her pain points are that she has various ingredients\n        but still have no idea what menu to cook and do not satisfy the random\n        menu function of other applications because she doesn't just want to\n        randomize the menus, but also wants to add other constraints on top of\n        it. For instance, she would like to limit the calories of generated\n        menus.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The second persona is an unemployed girl who stayed at home. She felt\n        bored and wanted to find things to do to upskill her portfolio so she\n        can be back in employment. However, the home environment prevented her\n        from starting anything productive. For her demographic, she is 24 years\n        old living in Bangkok, Thailand. She is still looking for a job and is\n        single at the moment.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"px-5\">\n        <Carousel prevLabel nextLabel interval=\"2000\">\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img className=\"d-block w-100 \" src={p1} alt=\"First slide\" fluid />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img className=\"d-block w-100 \" src={p2} alt=\"Second slide\" fluid />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n        </Carousel>\n      </div>\n      <h3 className=\"pb-2\">User Journey Map</h3>\n      <p>We separate our persona’s journey into 4 consecutive stages:</p>\n      <p>\n        The first stage is when the day starts in the morning. They wake up and\n        perform their morning routines. In this stage, we set their action to\n        eating breakfast and taking a shower. The users question themself what\n        to eat in the morning, and they are happy to eat healthy food. Despite\n        their happiness, they could not wake up on time and usually passed this\n        stage of the journey. We found opportunities in providing suggestions\n        about having breakfast and morning workouts.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Next, our users move on to attending classes. They go online waiting for\n        classes to attend. While they are waiting they question themself, why\n        does it take so long to start the class, and muddle off various things?\n        In attending classes, there are many happy moments from interesting\n        topics in classes. However, when they are attending the class, they need\n        to focus and participate. Therefore, we found an opportunity to relieve\n        stress during the class in short breaks and cheer up students with\n        trigger messages.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In our third stage, after students had finished morning class, they had\n        lunch. In this stage, they spend their time relaxing from the morning\n        class. They had questions about what to eat for lunch and what to\n        prepare for the coming up class. At this stage, they found out that they\n        are happy by having good and healthy food. However, while they are\n        relaxing, they are also worried about the upcoming class, what to\n        prepare, and when to attend.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Next is the last stage, their free time. In their free time, they\n        usually find entertainment such as Netflix, snacks, showering, or any\n        activities to chill themselves out and relax. During their free time,\n        they question what they should do, their performance for today, and what\n        to do next. They are happy to end the day and go to bed productively.\n        They find it is difficult to do homework and study, and they also feel\n        bad when they have too much free time. They feel unproductive.\n        Therefore, the opportunity for us is to suggest their entertainment and\n        make unusual daily entertainments.\n      </p>\n      <Image\n        src={j1}\n        className=\"rounded mx-auto d-block px-5\"\n        alt=\"User Journey Map\"\n        fluid\n      />\n\n      <h3 className=\"pb-2\">The application design using Adobe XD</h3>\n      <p>\n        We designed a prototype of the mobile application for solving the\n        problem of being bored during the lockdown due to the spread of\n        COVID-19. In the application, users are able to view the contents\n        available in the application as well as see the trending activities or\n        the recommended tasks from their friends. Users can click on the content\n        to view the description and can also search for content or friends on\n        this tab. You can explore more of these in the Adobe XD link for the\n        users below. The application is designed for both users and the admin of\n        the application. For users, there are two choices for them to choose\n        when they want to use BeatUp, which are application and website. The\n        only difference between application and website is the sizing of the\n        user interface that is resized to suit the screen size of computer and\n        mobile. The users can upload some content after being approved by the\n        admin. For the admin, only the phone-based design version is provided.\n        The role of the admin is to monitor, manage, and approve uploader\n        requests as well as uploaded content.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"font-weight-bold\">\n        You can access all of the designs by clicking the link embedded in each\n        of them.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <Link\n            to=\"https://xd.adobe.com/view/eebf1c65-3a1a-4b96-82c2-bd2ac79aa12b-bbec/\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n          >\n            Mobile design for the users\n          </Link>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <Link\n            to=\"https://xd.adobe.com/view/e8db0b05-c6da-46a3-80e4-4f717fd80447-bd88/\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n          >\n            Website design for the users\n          </Link>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <Link\n            to=\"https://xd.adobe.com/view/f73cb732-04db-46ed-9738-7abfcdf77f3a-a26f/\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n          >\n            Mobile design for the admin\n          </Link>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <Footer></Footer>\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default cookBurnPage\n"],"names":["_excluded","Image","_ref","ref","bsPrefix","className","fluid","rounded","roundedCircle","thumbnail","props","classes","displayName","defaultProps","Header","style","margin","maxWidth","paddingBottom","Carousel","prevLabel","nextLabel","interval","src","bu1","alt","bu2","bu3","bu4","bu5","bu6","p1","p2","j1","Link","to","target","Footer"],"sourceRoot":""}

The bipedal walking robots\n        are a humanoid robot model that has sparked a great deal of interest in\n        the past few decades, which is a challenging task as our agent needs\n        to run fast without tripping itself, leading to a massive drop in\n        rewards. Below is the discussion of states, actions, transition\n        dynamics, and the reward function for this problem.\n      </p>\n      <h4 className=\"pb-2 px-5\">States</h4>\n      <p className=\"px-5\">\n        The state space size for this problem is 24, which is continuous. States\n        consist of several parameters, including hull angle speed, angular\n        velocity, horizontal speed, vertical speed, the position of joints and\n        joints angular speed, legs contact with the ground, and ten lidar\n        rangefinder measurements. There are no coordinates in the state vector.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4 className=\"pb-2 px-5\">Actions</h4>\n      <p className=\"px-5\">\n        The size of the action space for this problem is 4. The BipedalWalker\n        has two legs; each leg has two joints. These joints are hips and knees,\n        each with the same action space in the range [-1, 1].\n      </p>\n      <h4 className=\"pb-2 px-5\">Reward Function</h4>\n      <p className=\"px-5\">\n        The maximum earning a reward is 300 points which increases\n        proportionally to the distance the bipedal walker walks on the terrain.\n        There are two negative rewards; one is proportional to the torque\n        applied to the joint, and another is -100 for tumbling. Therefore,\n        walking with minimal torque is optimal and avoids falling when the hull\n        contacts the ground.\n      </p>\n      <h3 className=\"pb-2\">Method</h3>\n      <p>\n        The DDPG is a model-free off-policy actor-critic algorithm for learning\n        continuous actions that Q-Learning cannot handle. It applies the\n        Actor-Critic algorithm to Q-Learning, allowing DDPG to tackle continuous\n        action spaces. Like DQN, there are two core mechanisms with a slight\n        adaptation in DDPG: replay memory and the periodically updated target\n        network. The DDPG does not learn from the most recent state transition\n        that the agent experiences for the replay memory. It keeps track of the\n        total experiences and random samples from them at each timestep to get\n        batches of memories and update the networks’ weights. The DDPG has two\n        target networks since it is an Actor-Critic method. Each target network\n        determines the value of the action specified by online networks: actor\n        and critic networks. The values from target networks are then used to\n        update the weights of the deep neural network. Therefore, this method\n        involves four networks: actor, target actor, critic, and target critic\n        networks.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"px-5\">\n        <Carousel prevLabel nextLabel interval=\"2000\">\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={ddpgDG}\n              alt=\"First slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={ddpgAG}\n              alt=\"Second slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n        </Carousel>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        The above DDPG algorithm and diagram demonstrate the steps to implement\n        this model. To initialise the actor and critic network, we set the\n        number of nodes in fully connected layers to be 400 and 300 with the\n        ReLU activation function as recommended. While the actor network’s\n        output channel number is set according to the action number using tanh\n        as the activation function, the critic network’s final layer has only\n        one node. The learning rate for actor and critic networks, alpha=0.0001\n        and beta=0.001, respectively, is set according to the suggestion. This\n        algorithm has three primary points:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The update rule for the actor-network</li>\n        <li>The update rule for the critic network</li>\n        <li>The target networks with the soft copy concept</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h3 className=\"pb-2\">Result</h3>\n      <p>\n        The full project report and algorithm can be found in my{\" \"}\n        <Link to=\"https://github.com/nutidol/DDPGBipedalWalker\">\n          github\n        </Link>.{\" \"}\n        Below is the result after the robot learns how to walk with the DDPG\n        agent compared to the random agent.\n      </p>\n      <div>\n        <div\n          className=\"px-5\"\n          style={{\n            position: \"relative\",\n            paddingTop: \"56.25%\",\n            marginBottom: \"50px\",\n          }}\n        >\n          <iframe\n            src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TDYcXUJmAB4\"\n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            allowfullscreen=\"\"\n            className=\"px-5\"\n            title=\"cb\"\n            style={{\n              position: \"absolute\",\n              top: 0,\n              left: 0,\n              width: \"100%\",\n              height: \"100%\",\n            }}\n          ></iframe>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <Footer></Footer>\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default cookBurnPage\n"],"names":["cookBurnPage","React","Header","className","style","margin","maxWidth","paddingBottom","Carousel","prevLabel","nextLabel","interval","Item","src","ddpgDG","alt","fluid","ddpgAG","Link","to","position","paddingTop","marginBottom","frameborder","allowfullscreen","title","top","left","width","height","Footer"],"sourceRoot":""}

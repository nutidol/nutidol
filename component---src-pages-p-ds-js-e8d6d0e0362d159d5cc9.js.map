It is somewhat related to\n        <Link to=\"/p-dw\"> Data Warehousing Project in Retails</Link>. We chose\n        the K-Means Clustering Model, one of the ML models to perform advanced\n        analytics on Azure ML. In the video below, you can also find our Market\n        Basket Analysis or Association Analysis. With that, we can recommend to\n        customers what they should buy after selecting the first item. For\n        example, if the user decides to buy milk, we could suggest they buy eggs\n        as this item is associated. Next, we could combine associated items to\n        increase sales like milk and egg. This analysis could help reorganise\n        how the retail store place thing in-store or online to increase the\n        chance of selling those associated products.\n      </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>\n          For the data set, we used Kaggle, public data, that related to the\n          retail domain.\n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>\n        The main topics that were discussed in the video below are the brief\n        summary of each type of machine learning, the introduction to our\n        project, the reasons for using Azure ML, applying the K-Means Clustering\n        Model with the dataset, and performing the market basket analysis.\n      </p>\n      <div>\n        <div\n          className=\"px-5\"\n          style={{\n            position: \"relative\",\n            paddingTop: \"56.25%\",\n            marginBottom: \"50px\",\n          }}\n        >\n          <iframe\n            src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGkc9OhO3Bg\"\n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            allowfullscreen=\"\"\n            className=\"px-5\"\n            title='ds'\n            style={{\n              position: \"absolute\",\n              top: 0,\n              left: 0,\n              width: \"100%\",\n              height: \"100%\",\n            }}\n          ></iframe>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <h3 className=\"pb-2\">Special thanks to</h3>\n      <p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Professor Peerapon Vateekul, PhD for being a very energetic and\n            enthusiastic instructor.\n          </li>\n          <li>TA Supakrit Paoliwat for being a super supportive senior.</li>\n          <li>Amy, Dao, and Art for being such great teammates.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <Footer></Footer>\n  </div>\n)\nexport default cookBurnPage\n"],"names":["className","style","margin","maxWidth","paddingBottom","Link","to","position","paddingTop","marginBottom","src","frameborder","allowfullscreen","title","top","left","width","height"],"sourceRoot":""}

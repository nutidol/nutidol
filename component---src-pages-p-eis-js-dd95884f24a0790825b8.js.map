Project\n      </h2>\n      <p className=\"text-center text-secondary\">Aug 2020 ~ Nov 2020</p>\n      <p className=\"text-center text-secondary\">\n        How can we apply the concept of Receipt-Based Reverse Engineering to\n        D’ORO, one of the Thai coffee brands?\n      </p>\n      <h3 className=\"pb-2\">Overview</h3>\n      <p>\n        This project’s goal is to obtain some fact findings from the receipt of\n        the coffee shop, D’ORO. We turn those facts into the possible issues\n        that could be the consequences of them as well as provide the solutions\n        utilising the open-source ERPNext.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3 className=\"pb-2\">Knowing D’ORO</h3>\n      <p>\n        I’m sure everyone has bought something from a store. After making a\n        payment you would get a paper receipt which sometime later we would\n        throw it away. We don’t really care about what is on the paper, but\n        actually, one receipt could really tell how one company operates. As you\n        may see from the receipt from a coffee shop called D’oro below, the date\n        the coffee is bought, a customer name, a level of the member, the names\n        of the product, the points, the price and even the method used to pay\n        this coffee. Little information like the method used to pay let us know\n        that somehow the company would have to communicate with a particular\n        payment service company.\n      </p>\n      <Image src={eis1} className=\"class-img-top px-5\" alt=\"d1\" fluid />\n      <p>\n        Let’s look into what we know more from the receipt. We see POS on the\n        top, so we know they have a POS system. There are names, tiers and\n        points, which means they must have a membership program. They could have\n        some promotions and rewards through that membership program as well. If\n        they have the customer’s information, they could also do direct\n        marketing. There is a name of the coffee and quantity, which mean they\n        could be able to collect the information of their sales. There is a type\n        of payment, which mean there must have many payment methods available\n        for the customer to use. Also, they need to have financial management\n        behind that.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"px-5\">\n        <Carousel fade prevLabel nextLabel variant=\"dark\" interval=\"2000\">\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis2}\n              alt=\"First slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis3}\n              alt=\"Second slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis4}\n              alt=\"Third slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis5}\n              alt=\"Forth slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n        </Carousel>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        So after seeing the receipt it leads to knowing some pieces of their\n        ecosystem and even more searching for their whole ecosystem.

After that, the raw material will be\n        picked up by the transportation company in order to transport those\n        items to the Golden cream company, which is the head office. The\n        ingredients will then be transported to each store and branch.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4 className=\"pb-2 px-5\">Money and credits</h4>\n      <p className=\"px-5\">\n        In terms of money and credits, the money flows mainly in and out of\n        Golden Cream Company. The money will be transferred to the\n        transportation company in order to transport the raw material from the\n        provider. In addition, D’Oro needs to pay the service fee to the\n        delivery company. On the other hand, D’Oro gets money from customers\n        when purchasing goods or products both from the shop and through the\n        delivery service. However, the customer may purchase drinks and bakeries\n        from the competitor’s shop.\n      </p>\n      <h4 className=\"pb-2 px-5\">Information</h4>\n      <p className=\"px-5\">\n        In terms of Information, when customers register and purchase products,\n        D’Oro will collect this information, which will be later sent to Golden\n        cream company. The information will also be sent to the advertisement\n        company in order to craft the new advertisement that answers the needs\n        of customers. Also, all the information will be sent to the IT system\n        company for further usage.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4 className=\"pb-2 px-5\">Intangible Values</h4>\n      <p className=\"px-5\">\n        For Intangible Values, brand loyalty may be developed through the\n        service and product that the customer continues to purchase from D’Oro\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"px-5\">\n        <Carousel prevLabel nextLabel interval=\"2000\" variant=\"dark\">\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis7}\n              alt=\"First slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis8}\n              alt=\"Second slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis9}\n              alt=\"Third slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis10}\n              alt=\"Forth slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n        </Carousel>\n      </div>\n\n      <p>\n        Next, let’s take a look at the D’ORO System Diagrams that our group\n        created. This system diagram is the combination between data flow\n        diagram (green part) and network diagram (grey part) showing the\n        dataflow among 4 major sectors which are central head office, suppliers,\n        warehouses, and branches where the data flow shows the big picture of\n        how the company runs from head office to other company in the ecosystem,\n        warehouse, and each shop. Yet show how the data flows through which\n        nodes such as the shops that are responsible for sending the transaction\n        information to the central head office.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As you can see there are only 3 main suppliers which are raw material\n        providers such as cups, napkins, the VPP company(for coffee), and CARA\n        company(for bakery). The network diagram that shows the communication\n        via the internet contains three main parts which are warehouses, central\n        head office, and branches.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"px-5\">\n        <Carousel prevLabel nextLabel interval=\"2000\" variant=\"dark\">\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis11}\n              alt=\"First slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis12}\n              alt=\"Second slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n        </Carousel>\n      </div>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>\n          All the information we mentioned so far lets us know more about the\n          DORO and we may see that some possible problems can occur within the\n          organisation such as this linkage….\n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <h3 className=\"pb-2\">Possible Issues</h3>\n      <p>\n        From the ecosystem and system diagram, you can see there can be a lot of\n        information flowing from one place to another. The data from the\n        receipt, the data from the company, Along the route, they collect all\n        these data because they are useful. It can help improve their business.\n        But this seems to be quite an amount of data collected, so how do they\n        store this information, and how do they analyse it though? Because it\n        would be useless if we have the information in the wrong place, or even\n        with the wrong inputs. We do some more research and found out that the\n        shop manager would be the one who collect the data. Manually. He or she\n        may need to pull all the data together, then write or keying it down,\n        and then send the data or report to the headquarters. But this is done\n        by the action of a human.

Wouldn’t that have an effect on the\n        customer or even the shop itself? Imagine OVERKeying the number of\n        orders down, with an extra zero from 10 to 100. It would be a waste.\n        Imagine typing in the wrong information of how a customer makes a\n        payment. Then we would later have to reconcile the service fee with the\n        payment company. Or Imagine keying the wrong information about a\n        customer, let’s say his birthday and sending him a birthday promotion on\n        the wrong date… It would affect his experience with a coffee shop for\n        sure.\n      </p>\n      <Image src={eis14} className=\"class-img-top px-5\" alt=\"issue2\" fluid />\n      <h3 className=\"pb-2\">Solution</h3>\n      <p>\n        So, how can D’Oro prevent this from happening, or how can D’oro improve\n        its services? Can we turn everything online or can we do the digital\n        transformation? Enterprise Resource Planning is one of the tools or\n        technologies that many companies use to transform their business into\n        the digital world.\n      </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>\n          Starbuck, for instance, discovered that their annual costs for their\n          supply chain was growing and over the same period annual sales at\n          stores that were opened for at least one year dropped by 10%. This is\n          before they started using the ERP system. Starbucks can then earn $500\n          million in savings in the 2 years after the implementation of the ERP\n          system. As it is able to manage the purchasing of goods from many\n          coffee plants throughout the world, eliminating the need for paper\n          forms and email, and automatically updating the purchases.\n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>\n        From our perspective, the followings are the ERP modules that will suit\n        the D’ORO system:\n      </p>\n      <h4 className=\"pb-2 px-5\">Supply Chain Management</h4>\n      <p className=\"px-5\">\n        With the Supply Chain Management, we can track each step in the movement\n        of supplies and goods throughout the supply chain from suppliers to CARA\n        and VPP to D’ORO shop and consumers. This module provides real-time data\n        so that the manager can be able to make decisions based on the most\n        up-to-date information. It can manage any materials or products returned\n        for refund or replacement. And can also Reduce the overhead costs of the\n        D’ORO company.\n      </p>\n      <h4 className=\"pb-2 px-5\">Financial Management</h4>\n      <p className=\"px-5\">\n        It helps a business to keep track of its overall finances. As there are\n        multiple payment methods for customers at D’oro including rabbit line\n        pay and QR code payment, it is important that D’oro have a record of all\n        the transactions especially when they have to manage service fees with\n        other companies. They have to ensure that the number of payments using\n        rabbit line pay from D’oro data is the same as the data in Line Company.\n      </p>\n      <h4 className=\"pb-2 px-5\">Customer Relationship Management</h4>\n      <p className=\"px-5\">\n        CRM software can help organize the way that companies interact with\n        customers, leading to satisfied customers. As we mentioned earlier that\n        D’oro has a membership and point rewards system for their customers, it\n        would be more efficient if D’oro had the records of each member,\n        especially their birthday and favourite drinks. With the use of customer\n        behaviour, D’oro can come up with a promotion that suits well with their\n        customers.\n      </p>\n      <h4 className=\"pb-2 px-5\">Human Resource Management</h4>\n      <p className=\"px-5\">\n        HRM is meant for proper utilization of available skilled workforce and\n        also to make efficient use of existing human resources in the\n        organization. D’oro can keep the record of their general information\n        employee for example position, and contact information and to ensure\n        that their employee has all the skills needed for the coffee shop for\n        example service and drinks preparation.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"px-5\">\n        <Carousel variant=\"dark\" prevLabel nextLabel interval=\"2000\">\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis15}\n              alt=\"First slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis16}\n              alt=\"Second slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis17}\n              alt=\"Third slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis18}\n              alt=\"Forth slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n          <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n              className=\"d-block w-100 \"\n              src={eis19}\n              alt=\"Fifth slide\"\n              fluid\n            />\n          </Carousel.Item>\n        </Carousel>\n      </div>\n      <p>It can be summarised that applying the ERP package:</p>\n      <p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Can enhance the business report with better real-time information\n            and a single integrated database for all business processes.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Can have better customer services as the better access to customer\n            information, faster response time.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Can improve inventory cost as if the company is well planned then we\n            could reduce the overhead cost.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            Can have better supply chain management as we could have effective\n            demand forecasting and lean inventory.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            Can have better data security as we could reduce the data\n            distribution across multiple servers.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>\n          Sap and Oracle are the top two ERP vendors in ERP market share.\n          However, the licensed ERP is very expensive.
